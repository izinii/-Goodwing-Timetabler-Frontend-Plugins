# Goodwing-Timetabler-Frontend-Plugins
 This repository is based on the **Goodwing-Timetabler** project, but with additional functionalities, including a frontend and various plugins.

The folder `Goodwing-Timetabler` is a submodule pointing to the **Goodwing-Timetabler** project (another repository on my GitHub, forked from @Hu9o73).


### Be carefull
If the submodule is modified, it must be committed and pushed separately from the main repository.
This requires navigating into the submodule folder and executing the necessary Git commands to save the changes.
